# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Streamlit-Webapp


Welcome to the Multiple Disease Prediction Web App repository! This web application is built using Streamlit and contains three machine learning prediction models for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

# Features
Diabetes Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
Heart Disease Prediction: Predicts the risk of heart disease based on input features such as age, sex, cholesterol level, etc.
Parkinson's Disease Prediction: Predicts the presence of Parkinson's disease based on input features related to motor symptoms.
